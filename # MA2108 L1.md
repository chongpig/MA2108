## 1. Characterization of R
* Recall : definition of a field
	Afield is a set F with 2 operations:
	* + : F + F -> F "addition"
	* * : F * F -> F "multiplication"
	example of fields: $N^+$(not a field, 0 not included ), Z(not a field, $1/2$not included) Q, R
* Two ways of represent a real number :
	1. real number as an infinite decimal
	2. real number line
* Prop: R $\neq$ Q ie. there sxists a rewal number which is not rational
	Proof: consider $\sqrt{2} \in R$, can show  $\sqrt{2} \notin Q$
## 2. field
* Def total order: Let S be a set. A total order on S is a relation denoted '<'  such that :
	1. If $x, y \in S$ , then  on of the following holds: x < y ot x=y or y < x
	2. If $x,y,z \in S$ x<y, y<z ,then x < z
* Def : An ordered set: a set S with some total order
* Def : An ordered field is a field F which is an ordered set such that 
	1. if $x,y,z \in F, y<Z,then x+y<x+z$
	2. $xy>0 if x>0 and y>0$
	    eg: R, Q ordered fields with usual order.
	    C is not ordered field

## 1. upper/lower bound:
Def upper/lower bound: Let S be an ordered set, $E \subseteq S$ , If there exists $\beta \in S, x<= \beta,for all x\in E$,say E is bounded above, say $\beta$ is an upper bound
* Remark:
	1.Upper bounds and lower bounds may not be unique
	2.Sets may be bounded above but not below
	3.Sets may be bounded below but not above
	4.Unbounded:not bounded above and below
	5.bounded: both bounded above and below
	Def least upper bound:  Let S be an ordered set, $E \subseteq S$, suppose that E is bounded above. If  $\beta \in S$ such that, (1) $\beta$ is an upper bound of E,(2) for all $\gamma < \beta, \gamma$ is not an upper bound of E, say $\beta$ is a least upper bound/supremum of E,$\beta = sup(E)$
	Def greatest lower bound: infimum(inf)
* Remark: sup != max, sup may not lies in the set, but max is always in the set

Eg: $E = {x\inQ,| x>0,x^2 < 2} \subseteq Q$ , E is bounded , but has no sup

* Lemma:(uniqueness of least upper bound) ; Given $E\subseteq S$ ,if a least upper bound exists, the it is unique(hence can say 'the' least upper bound/the sup)
	proof: If $\alpha, \alpha'$ are tow lub of E, by (1)"upper bound" applied to $\alpha$ (2) "least" applied to $\alpha'$ we can get$\alpha >= \alpha'$ , switch  $\alpha, \alpha'$ ,we can get  $\alpha' >= \alpha$ , then $\alpha =  \alpha'$
	
* Def lub propertty: Let S be ordered set. We say that S has lub property if for all subsets $E \subseteq S$ ,such that $E != \emptyset$ and E bounded above, least upper bound of E exists

* Theorem Completeness of R: There exists an ordered field (unique ro isomorphism) which has the lub definition , Moreover , F contains Q as a subfield ,We define R  to be this field
Remark: Key takeaway : R has the lub property

## 1. Theorem:
* If S ordered set with lub property rhen it satisfies: for any non-empty subset $B\subseteqS$ bounded below, there exists a greatest lower bound of B in S
* pf: 
	1.  call the set of lower bounds of B L, B bounded below => L != $\emptyset$
	2. L is bounded above because any x$\in$ B satisfies x>=y for y$\in$L
	3. L satisfies condition to apply lub property => L has lub, sup(L) = $\alpha$
